NameError is an exception class

Exceptions are how Ruby draws your attention to problems in the code. When an error in the code is encountered, an exception is "raised" or "thrown" and the program shuts down by default.

Ruby publishes an exception hierarchy with predefined classes. NameErrors are in the StandardError class, along with RuntimeError, ThreadError, RangeError, ArgumentError and others. This class includes most of the normal exceptions that you encounter in typical Ruby programs.
